# reshade-elex UHD
Reshade profile for Elex for UltraHD video resolution (3840x2160).

Elex is known to support no more than 2560x1600. But this resolution is not really a technical constraint, but just a precautionary measure from Pyranha Bytes for people who may complain about poor performance. Nvidia GTX 1080, especiall dual Titan X, can carry it at almost 90 FPS! Or maybe not. I suppose that UHD gamers already know everything about really bad performance, and therefore they can try advanced modes on their own responsibility.
